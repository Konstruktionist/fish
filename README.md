# A short description of the functions

### Functions with dependencies on non-standard installed tools*
 _\* on MacOS (OS X)_

* **chosts.fish** _depends on [**dateutils**][fresse]_
* **img_size.fish** _depends on [**imagemagick**][imagemagick]_.
* **fixdate.fish** _depends on **SetFile**_  
    SetFile is a macOS (OS X) tool installed by Xcode.  
    From its manpage :  
    _Tools supporting Carbon development, including /usr/bin/SetFile, were deprecated with Xcode 6._  
    Its documentation says it is deprecated, but for now it works. (With Xcode 8 it still gets installed).  
* **mdb.fish** _depends on [**tag**][github]_.
* **testmovies.fish** _depends on [**mediainfo**][mediaarea]_.
* **xpstatus.fish** _depends on **GetFileInfo**_  
Like _SetFile_ also a deprecated tool installed by Xcode.  

> These tools were installed with [brew][brew].

#### In alphabetical order

* **apply_settings**  
Set up fish universal variables. At the moment all color related.  
I'm using a customised SpaceGray theme. The standard colors fish comes with don't work very well with this theme. When I set up a Mac this function makes it easy to apply the colors that I found to be working best for me. It has taken an inordinate amount of time to get to these, so it's important to preserve them even if this function is never called again during the computers lifetime.

_Output_:  
      `tool_name depends on: some_other_tool(s)`

Print a list of `brew` installed tools and which other tools use this.  
_Output_:

* **getnet**  
Get network information.  
I don't use this anymore because newer Mac's may not have a physical ethernet port.
