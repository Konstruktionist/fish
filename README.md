## In alphabetical order

* **ag**  
Change the colors of ag (the silver searcher) output.
I don't like the yellow boxes that show up in the default settings.
Changed to green underlined matches, light yellow pathnames & light blue line numbers.

* **apply_settings**  
Set up fish universal variables. At the moment all color related.    
I'm using a customized SpaceGray theme. The standard colors fish comes with don't work very well with this theme. When I set up a Mac this function makes it easy to apply the colors that I found to be working best for me. It has taken an inordinate amount of time to get to these, so it's important to preserve them even if this function is never called again during the computers lifetime.

* **brdeps**  
Print a list of `brew` installed tools and their dependencies.  
Takes optional arguments, if there are none it will display a list of all installed tools.  
_Output_:  
      `tool_name depends on: some_other_tool(s)`

* **brused**  
Print a list of `brew` installed tools and which other tools use this.  
Takes optional arguments, if there are none it will display a list of all installed tools.  
_Output_:  
       `tool_name used by: some_other_tool(s)`

* **build_iosevka**  
A script to build a custom version of the [Iosevka][iosevka] font.  

* **bup**  
Three consecutive commands to keep homebrew up to date and lean.  
`brew update`, `brew upgrade` and finally `brew cleanup`.  
This will update _everything_ that is installed via a brew command for which a newer version is available.

* **cdl**  
Change to a directory and list its contents with a long listing.

* **chosts**  
Compare the local date with the date on the net for my hosts file and see if it's behind.

* **cleands**  
Recursively delete ".DS_Store" files

* **cleanLaunchServices**  
Clean up LaunchServices to remove duplicates in the "_Open With_" menu.

* **cpuhogs**  
Find what's hogging the CPU. Kinda like a Top 10 list.

* **decrypt**  
Decrypt a file.

* **domaininfo**  
Get information for a FQDN (fully qualified domain name). 
It's a wrapper around `dig`, [ipinfo.io][ipinfo] & a `whois` query.  
I used this to block Facebook, after reading [this][perpetual-beta] blogpost.
Useful to block tracking servers or other pests on the internet.

* **down4me**  
Checks whether a website is down just for you, or everybody.

* **efi-check**  
Check to see if the EFI version is up to date.

* **emptytrash**  
Empty the Trash on all mounted volumes and the main HDD.  
Also, clear Appleâ€™s System Logs (asl) to improve shell startup speed.

* **encrypt**  
Encrypt a file.

* **extract**  
Extract the given archive into a folder.

* **fish\__some\_function_**
functions for the shell's own use.

   * **fish\_command\_timer**  
   Time stamp & command execution time at the right hand side of the terminal.  
   Copied from [jichu4n][jichu4n] and slightly adapted

   * **fish\_greeting**  
   Displays OS & uptime.

   * **fish\_prompt**  
   Prompt line with git info.

   * **fish**\__something\_else\_then\_above_  
   Usually a small helper function that is called from other functions.  
   ***Not*** to be used on its own! They are most likely to be destructive in nature.

* **fixdate**  
Extract dates from filenames and put those in the date created & modified metadata.

* **free**  
Emulates the `free` function from Linux.  
Shows free & used memory in human readable format.

* **getnet**  
Get network information.  
I don't use this anymore because newer Mac's may not have a physical Ethernet port.  
Replacement is `netinfo`.

* **git_helpers**  
get a nice git log output with colors and in neat columns.  
A reconstruction of [Gary Bernhardt][GB]'s `githelpers.sh` script & his `.gitconfig` aliases.  
This is how it looks:  
![git log output][imgur]  
and a bit more interesting  
![Textual log output][Textual]

* **prompt\_git\_status**  
Helper function for fish_prompt.

* **restore\_original\_fish_colors**
