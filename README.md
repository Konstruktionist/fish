# A short description of the functions

### Functions with dependencies on non-standard installed tools

* chosts.fish _depends on [**dateutils**](http://www.fresse.org/dateutils)_
* img_size.fish _depends on [**imagemagick**](https://imagemagick.org)_.
* fixdate.fish _depends on **SetFile**_  
    SetFile is a macOS (OS X) tool installed by Xcode.  
    From its manpage :  
    _Tools supporting Carbon development, including /usr/bin/SetFile, were deprecated with Xcode 6._  
    Its documentation says it is deprecated, but for now it works. (With Xcode 8 it still gets installed).  
* mdb.fish _depends on [**tag**](https://github.com/jdberry/tag)_.
* testmovies.fish _depends on [**mediainfo**](http://mediaarea.net)_.
