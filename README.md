#### In alphabetical order

* **ag**  
Change the colors of ag (the silver searcher) output.
I don't like the yellow boxes that show up in the default settings.
Changed to green underlined matches, light yellow pathnames & light blue line numbers

* **apply_settings**  
Set up fish universal variables. At the moment all color related.    
I'm using a customized SpaceGray theme. The standard colors fish comes with don't work very well with this theme. When I set up a Mac this function makes it easy to apply the colors that I found to be working best for me. It has taken an inordinate amount of time to get to these, so it's important to preserve them even if this function is never called again during the computers lifetime.

* **brdeps**  
Print a list of `brew` installed tools and their dependencies.  
Takes optional arguments, if there are none it will display a list of all installed tools.  
_Output_:  
      `tool_name depends on: some_other_tool(s)`

* **brused**  
Print a list of `brew` installed tools and which other tools use this.  
Takes optional arguments, if there are none it will display a list of all installed tools.  
_Output_:  
       `tool_name used by: some_other_tool(s)`

This will update _everything_ that is installed via a brew command for which a newer version is available.

Recursively delete ".DS_Store" files

* **domaininfo**  
Get information for a FQDN (fully qualified domain name). 
It's a wrapper around `dig`, [ipinfo.io][ipinfo] & a `whois` query.

Useful to block tracking servers or other pests on the internet.

   * **fish**\__something\_else\_then\_above_  
   Usually a small helper function that is called from other functions.  
   ***Not*** to be used on its own! They are most likely to be destructive in nature.

* **fixdate**  
Extract dates from filenames and put those in the date created & modified metadata.

* **free**  
Emulates the `free` function from Linux.  
Shows free & used memory in human readable format.

* **fzf\_key\_bindings**

It's a symbolic link to key bindings for fzf which lives in `/usr/local/opt/fzf/shell/key-bindings.fish`.

* **totrash**  
Move a specified file to the Trash.

A dummy function to try out a new script. This gives me time to think of a good name (_it doesn't always work out_).
